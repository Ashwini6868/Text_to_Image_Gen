# Text_to_Image_Gen
Text-to-image conversion is a fascinating area in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) where algorithms generate visual content based on textual descriptions. Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art tools in this domain, capable of creating highly realistic and detailed images.

## Install
To set up the environment, use the following commands:

!pip install torch torchvision transformers datasets accelerate diffusers huggingface_hub
!pip install datasets

## Collect Dataset from Huggingface

**Use the following code snippet to load the dataset:**

from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset('poloclub/diffusiondb') 

## framework‚Å†
`[path/to/your/image.jpg](https://github.com/Ashwini6868/Text_to_Image_Gen/blob/main/framework.png)`



## Results
- Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the actual path or URL to the image you want to display. If the image is stored in your repository, you can use relative paths like `./images/my_image.jpg` or host it elsewhere and use the URL.
